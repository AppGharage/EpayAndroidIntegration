# EpayAndroidIntegration
An android app to show how Epay Payment API can be integrated.

To be able to use our APIs, you will first need to create an Integration. The integration you create gives you an app_id and app_secret to generate an API access token.

Submit a POST request to https://epaygh.com/v1/token to obtain an access token. This access token grants you access to all protected resources. To get your access token, you will need a merchant_key, app_id and app_secret.
